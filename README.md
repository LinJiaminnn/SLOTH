Hi, there! I'm having a go at writing a n-dim(nâ‰¤3) linear algebra tensor lib in c++ which provides access to GPU-based operations relying on CUDA Toolkit for GPU support. (Still There are many issues concerning of efficiency, robustness and code migration to be sorted out, but it's an interesting start for beginners like me? Haha. )
